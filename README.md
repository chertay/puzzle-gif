# Getting Started

 0. `npm install -g bower` (if you don't have bower)
 1. `gem install bundler`
 2. `bundle install`
 3. `bower install`
 3. `bundle exec jekyll serve` to serve

You should then be able to preview it locally at `http://localhost:4000`

Alternatively, on OSX:

```bash
make install
make setup
make serve
```
